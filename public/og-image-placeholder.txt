OG Image Placeholder

To create the Open Graph image (og-image.png):

1. Create a 1200x630 PNG image
2. Use the Matrix green theme (#00FF41)
3. Include text: "LinEnum.sh - Don't Be a Dumbass"
4. Add subtitle: "Scripted Local Linux Enumeration & Privilege Escalation Checks"
5. Include warning symbol and educational theme
6. Save as public/og-image.png

You can use tools like:
- Canva (https://canva.com)
- Figma (https://figma.com)
- Photoshop
- Or any online OG image generator

Recommended layout:
- Dark background or white background with green accents
- Matrix-style font for the title
- Warning symbols (⚠️)
- Terminal/command line aesthetic
- GitHub logo/link in corner

For now, you can use a simple placeholder or skip it - the site will work without it.
