> **Scripted Local Linux Enumeration & Privilege Escalation Checks**  
> An educational security project teaching developers and security professionals why they should **never blindly execute scripts from the internet**.

## 🚨 The Problem

Every day, countless tutorials and documentation tell users to run commands like:

```bash
curl https://some-website.com/install.sh | bash
```

This is **extremely dangerous**. When you do this, you're:

- ❌ Executing code you haven't reviewed
- ❌ Trusting a remote server completely
- ❌ Potentially compromising your entire system
- ❌ Opening yourself to credential theft
- ❌ Allowing backdoor installation
- ❌ Risking malware or ransomware infection

## 💡 The Solution

**LinEnum.sh** demonstrates this risk in a harmless, educational way. When you run:

```bash
curl linenum.sh | bash
```

Instead of a malicious script, you get:
1. A clear warning message about the dangers
2. A friendly ASCII art Rickroll
3. Your country logged for statistics (IP is NOT stored)

No harm done - just a valuable lesson learned! 🎓

## 🛡️ The Right Way

Always review scripts before executing them:

```bash
# ✅ DO THIS:
curl https://example.com/script.sh -o script.sh
cat script.sh  # Review the contents!
vim script.sh  # Or use your preferred editor
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh

# ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
curl https://example.com/script.sh | bash
```

## 📦 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/thedr0pperx/linenum.sh)

1. Fork this repository
2. Import to Vercel
3. Add a Vercel KV database in your project
4. Deploy!

The environment variables will be automatically populated by Vercel KV.

### Custom Domain

1. Add your domain in Vercel project settings
2. Update DNS records as instructed by Vercel
3. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning

## 🎨 Customization

The project uses a Matrix-inspired theme adapted for light backgrounds. Colors are defined in `tailwind.config.ts`:

```typescript
colors: {
  matrix: {
    green: '#00FF41',
    dark: '#F5F5F5',
    darker: '#FFFFFF',
    accent: '#00CC33',
    border: '#00FF4180',
  }
}
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **No IP Storage**: We use your IP only to determine country, then discard it immediately
- **Anonymous Statistics**: We only store country codes for statistics
- **No Tracking Cookies**: No third-party analytics or tracking
- **Open Source**: Full transparency - all code is public
- **Educational Purpose**: Data used only for demonstration

## 📊 API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main website (or rickroll script if curl)
- `GET /api/curl` - Rickroll script endpoint
- `GET /api/curls/recent` - Last 10 curl events
- `GET /api/curls/leaderboard` - Top 10 countries
- `GET /api/curls/map` - Countries that have curled
